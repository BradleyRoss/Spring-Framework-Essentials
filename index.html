<h3>Comments and Errata</h3>
<ul>
<li>In com.oreilly.repositories.JdbcAccountRepository, the constructor
    has an Autowired annotation.  This appears to be incorrect.</li>
<li>A number of import statements were commented out because they are
    unused and gave
    warning messages in Eclipse.</li>
<li>I have found import static, import with wildcards hurt maintainability and
    readability in the long run.  They can also cause problems with your code if your external 
    jar files change.  The reason for this is that a change in the external code can cause
    a potential conflict to exist where one did not exist before.</li>
<li>The SuppressWarnings("Duplicates") exists in IntelliJ, but does appear in Eclipse.</li>
<li>The build process using Gradle on MacOS Eclipse can generate a warning indicating that a 
    copy of .DS_Store can't be copied to the output folder.  The file .DS_Store is a special file indicating 
    how the directory should appear in Finder and should not be copied by the build tasks.  The warning can
    be ignored.</li>
</ul>
