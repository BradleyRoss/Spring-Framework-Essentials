<p>This project is a fork of kousen/Spring-Framework-Essentials at
    a href="https://www.github.com/kousen/Spring-Framework-Essentials"

    https://www.github.com/kousen/Spring-Framework-Essentials<a>.
    Since the original project was distributed under the 
    MIT license, this fork is also being distributed under the 
    MIT license.
    I added some comments and made some minor changes to make the
    code more understandable to myself.</p>
   </p>
<h3>BootAccounts</h3>
<p><a href="BootAccounts/doc/" target="_blank">The Javadocs are located here</a></p>
<h3>DataAccounts</h3>
<p>This represents examples of Spring Data  and
   <a href="DataAccounts/doc/" target="_blank">the Javadocs are located here</a>.
   The examples are used in the video Spring Data JPA in the section Hibernate/JPA and
   Spring Data.</p>
<h3>JdbcAccount</h3>
<p><a href="JdbcAccounts/doc/" target="_blank">The Javadocs are located here</a> and the
   code is used in the section Data Access using JdbcTemplate.</p>

<h3>JpaAccounts</h3>
<p>These examples involve the use of Hibernate and JPA (Java Persistance Architecture) and
   <a href="JpaAccounts/doc/" target="_blank">the Javadocs are located here.</a><p>

<h3>SpringBaseball</h3>
<p><a href="SpringBaseball/doc/" target="_blank">The Javadocs are located here</a>
   and the code is used in the following sections:  Building Applications,
   Configuring Beans, and Aspect Oriented Programming.</p>

<h3>Comments and Errata</h3>
<ul>
<li>In com.oreilly.repositories.JdbcAccountRepository, the constructor
    has an Autowired annotation.  This appears to be incorrect.</li>
<li>A number of import statements were commented out because they are
    unused and gave
    warning messages in Eclipse.</li>
<li>I have found import static, import with wildcards hurt maintainability and
    readability in the long run.  They can also cause problems with your code if your external 
    jar files change.  The reason for this is that a change in the external code can cause
    a potential conflict to exist where one did not exist before.</li>
<li>In a few cases, I changed some of the fields and methods from private to protected.  If a private field or
    method is not used in the class, the Eclipse IDE generates a warning.  Switching the item to protected
    does not change the meaning of the code, but does eliminate the warning message.</li>
<li>The SuppressWarnings("Duplicates") exists in IntelliJ, but does appear in Eclipse.</li>
<li>The build process using Gradle on MacOS Eclipse can generate a warning indicating that a 
    copy of .DS_Store can't be copied to the output folder.  The file .DS_Store is a special file indicating 
    how the directory should appear in Finder and should not be copied by the build tasks.  The warning can
    be ignored.  I also added .DS_Store to .gitignore.</li>
<li>The MySQL account and password were both changed to <i>spring</i>.</li>
</ul>
