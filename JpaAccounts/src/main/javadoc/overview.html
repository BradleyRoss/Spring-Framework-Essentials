<h3>Javadocs</h3>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is necessary to manually load data.sql into the database before running the tests.  It looks like
    the table Account will be created by RunDemo, but the program will fail if the table 
    already exists.  So the steps appear to be, run RunDemo or the test suite, load the data into
    the table, and then run the test suites.</li>
<li>After the Account table has been created nd the initial data loaded, you can run the test
    sets as often as you want.</li>
<li>In the test sets you have static import statements.  These can be very confusing and troublesome.
    I have also found import statements with wild card characters (asterisks) to
    be a potential source of confusion at a later date.</li>
